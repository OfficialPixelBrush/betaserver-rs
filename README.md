# betaserver-rs
A **very** barebones Beta 1.7.3 Server written in Rust

## Purpose
This doubles as my first semi-proper Rust project, though its very crap.

If you're looking for a reimplementation of the Beta 1.7.3 Server software, check out [BetrockServer](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockServer).

Alternatively, if you're looking for a Rust reimplementation specifically, [mc173](https://github.com/mindstorm38/mc173) is extremely well done and feature complete!
